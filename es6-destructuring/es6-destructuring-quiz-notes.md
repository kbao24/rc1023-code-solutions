## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring lets you unpack data from array and objects so you can distribute them into variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  The syntax for Object destructuring is to use {} and put the properties inside then set it equal to an object.

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  The syntax is to use const [] and put the values inside the square brackets and set it equal to an array.
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  Using array literal means you need to make a new object or array with the literal notation. Meanwhile destructuring involves extracting values from existing objects and arrays.
