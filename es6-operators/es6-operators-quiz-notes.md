## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the `&&` (logical AND) and `||` (logical OR) operators and how can they be used outside of `if` statements?
  The && operator returns true if both operands are true and false if otherwise. || operator returns true if at least one operand is true, false if both are false.
- What is "short-circuit evaluation" and how does it apply to `&&` and `||`?
  If the && operand on left is false then you don't evaluate the right operand. If the || operand on left is true, right isn't evaluated.
- What is the `??` (nullish coalescing) operator and how does it differ from `||`?
  It returns the right-hand side operand when left operand is null or undefined
- What is the `?:` (ternary) operator? How does it differ from `if/else`?
  This is a way to write if-else statements by using the question mark symbol instead.
- What is the `?.` (optional chaining) operator? When would you use it?
  This lets you get properties from an object.
- What is `...` (spread) syntax? How do you use it with arrays and objects?
  It allows you to expand an array or string into areas where you need multiple elements
- What data types can be spread into an array? Into an object?
  You can spread arrays, strings, or objects
- How does spread syntax differ from rest syntax?
  Rest gets multiple elements into a single array while spread expands an array into individual elements.
