- What is the `event.target`?
  It is the DOM element that triggered the event.
- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  It makes the element invisible.
- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  You can use the getAttribute() method.
- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  You should be logging every time you make a new function or after a loop.s
- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  You would need to use an event listener for each tab.
