- Why do we log things to the console?
  Logging helps keep track of what our code is doing and will aid in debugging later on.
- What is a method?
  A method is an object property with a function value that can perform actions on an object.
- How is a method different from any other function?
  A method is different from a function because it is an object property, while a function is a block of code that can do a specific task.

- Do string methods change the original string? How would you check if you weren't sure?
  No, string methods return a new value but do not change the original variable. You can check using console.log().
- Roughly how many string methods are there according to the MDN Web docs?
  I believe there are 55 listed string methods on MDN? I saw this list on the string page on MDN, although some of these methods may be deprecated.
- Is the return value of a function or method useful in every situation?
  No, there are situations where you do not need to return. But generally speaking you should return something so JS knows the function has finished executing.
- Roughly how many array methods are there according to the MDN Web docs?
  Not sure, according to the left panel of the array page on MDN, I counted 52 array methods? Not sure how many of these are deprecated or still relevant.
