## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to repeat a task depending on the condition
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  A condition is what causes the loop while it is true, and to repeat until it becomes false. Once the condition is false, the loop ends.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Iteration means t
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  Iteration means to repeat in the context of loops.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  Initialization begins once you enter the loop. If you wrote for(let i = 0; i < something.length; i++) the intialization happens at 'let i = 0;
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  Like the previous example for(let i = 0; i < something.length; i++) condition happens at 'i < something.length'.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression of the loop gets evaluated when you increment. In this example, for(let i = 0; i < something.length; i++), it would be near the end at 'i++'.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  The 'break' keyword exits a loop before you meet the condition.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The increment operator increases the counter by 1.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You can interate through keys of an object by using a for loop.
