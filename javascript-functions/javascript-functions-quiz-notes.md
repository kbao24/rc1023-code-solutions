## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function in JavaScript is a block of code that is used to execute a specific task.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function definition starts with the function keyword, followed by the name of the function and its parameter(s) enclosed by parentheses and a set of curly braces. You then write the actual function code within the curly braces.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The parts of a function call are the function name and the parameter you want to pass through the function parentheses.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Calling the function will run the code, while defining a function just defines the function name.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is the name listed in the function defintion while the argument is the real value passed through the function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters allow you to pass values into a function that can be used to perform specific tasks.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement ends the function execution and returns the value of the function that was called.
