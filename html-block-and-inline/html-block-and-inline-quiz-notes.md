## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  They affect how elements stack vertically, starting from the top of the containings block.
- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  Inline elements are aligned both vertically and horizontally within each block container.
- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
  100% for width and height, or the height of the content and the length of the page.
- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  I would say it is also 100%. The line elements should appear on the same line unless there is line wrap.
